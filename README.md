# Mysterium Card Reader

A jQuery application that shuffles and draws
[Mysterium](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181304/mysterium) game cards.
Given a number of players, difficulty, and available expansions/promo cards, it
will provide you with a list of card numbers for each of the decks.

I used a web-based random number generator for this until I got the Secrets &
Lies expansion, which complicated matters by not having sequential numbering.

# Supported expansions

* [Mysterium: Hidden Signs](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/192661/mysterium-hidden-signs)
* [Mysterium: Secrets & Lies](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/192661/mysterium-hidden-signs)
* Promo cards 1-5

# Caveats

* I don't currently own Hidden Signs, so I'm assuming that its cards are
  numbered in the same sequence as Secrets & Lies.
* I'm a backend developer. Sorry about the code.
